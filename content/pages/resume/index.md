### <small>2016 - *current*</small> Lead full stack developer, 1egal2
* Lead the complete rewrite of [Arkothèque CMS](https://arkotheque.fr) to successfull completion with a team of 1 to 4 developpers over the course of the project, 1 webdesigner and 1 project manager. Using PHP 7, Symfony, React.js, MySQL and ElasticSearch. Used on websites such as [Archives de l'Allier](https://archives.allier.fr) or [Archives du cher](https://archives18.fr/). More than 20 websites hosted on our infrastructure collectively handle 10,000s of search requests and 100,000s of image requests per day
* Own >60% of the surviving code
* Changed the deployment procedures, from manual steps performed only by technical people to a completely automated process using bash scripts and CI tools, triggered from a UI by anyone on the team, achieving up to 15 deployments per day on multiple websites with near-zero deployment incidents in the last year
* Changed the deployment requirements from dedicated server only to VPS, Docker containers or self-hosting by customers
* Introduced code review, pair programming, blameless post-mortems and usage of an internal knowledge base to the team
* Introduced unit, integration and end-to-end tests using PHPUnit, Jest and Cypress
* Introduced monitoring and observability using ELK
* Introduced Kanban for project management and feature development
* Performed performance monitoring and optimisation, dividing average critical path load time by 2 while search queries multiplied by 7 in the last year
* Lead the GDPR compliance effort
* Created internal tooling to help the team monitor, operate and perform ETL into the application, using bash scripts and other CLI tools
* Created [Cuisine EAD](https://cuisine-ead.netlify.app), a tool for XML/EAD manipulation, on my free time but worked on it in the context of my work as it is used by clients and my colleagues. This is a Progressive Web App using React.js and Web Workers, hosted on netlify.
