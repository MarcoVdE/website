###__I'm a passionate problem-solver, invested in the projects I work on and the people I work with__.  

9 years of experience working on web applications, public-facing or otherwise.  
I'm involved in the definition of the problem, the architecture and the implementation of the solution.  

__I optimise for the success of the team and of the project.__  

I strive to follow engineering principles and industry best practices such as testing, accessibility, GDPR, performance, continuous integration, refactoring and code review.  
I'm comfortable with object-oriented and functional paradigms and often use both in my projects.
